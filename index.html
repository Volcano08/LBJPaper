        <p><strong>LYNDON B. JOHNSON (1908–1973)</strong><br>36th President of the United States (1963–1969)<br>Democratic Party</p>
        <p>Lyndon B. Johnson, born in a small farmhouse near Stonewall, Texas, rose to become one of the most transformative leaders in American history. He began his career as a teacher in a segregated school for Mexican-American students, an experience that deeply influenced his lifelong dedication to civil rights and education reforms.</p>
        <p>As a Senator, Johnson’s skill in negotiation and persuasion, famously known as the "Johnson Treatment," helped him achieve legislative success. As president, he championed major initiatives like the Civil Rights Act, Voting Rights Act, and the Great Society programs, which aimed to reduce poverty and eliminate racial injustice. His legacy is complex, with both monumental achievements and controversies, particularly surrounding the Vietnam War.</p>
